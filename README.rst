Requirements
------------

You will need the following prerequisites in order to use axe-selenium-python:

- selenium >= 3.0.0
- Python 2.7 or 3.6
- The appropriate driver for the browser you intend to use, downloaded and added to your path, e.g. geckodriver for Firefox:
  - `geckodriver <https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases>`_ downloaded and `added to your PATH <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40208051/selenium-using-python-geckodriver-executable-needs-to-be-in-path#answer-40208762>`_

Installation
------------

To install axe-selenium-python:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pip install axe-selenium-python


Usage
------

.. code-block:: python

 import pytest
  from selenium import webdriver
  from axe_selenium_python import Axe

  def test_google():
      driver = webdriver.Firefox()
      driver.get("http://www.google.com")
      axe = Axe(driver)
      # Inject axe-core javascript into page.
      axe.inject()
      # Run axe accessibility checks.
      results = axe.execute()
      # Write results to file
      axe.write_results('a11y.json', results)
      driver.close()
      # Assert no violations are found
      assert len(results["violations"]) == 0, axe.report(results["violations"])

The method ``axe.execute()`` accepts two parameters: ``context`` and ``options``.

For more information on ``context`` and ``options``, view the `aXe documentation here <https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core/blob/master/doc/API.md#parameters-axerun>`_.

CHANGELOG
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

version 2.1.0
**************
- Created package.json file to maintain axe-core dependency
- Replaced unit tests with more meaningful integration tests
  - included a sample html file for integration tests

version 2.0.0
**************
- All functionalities that are not part of axe-core have been moved into a separate package, ``pytest-axe``. This includes:
  - ``run_axe`` helper method
  - ``get_rules`` Axe class method
  - ``run`` Axe class method
  - ``impact_included`` Axe class method
  - ``analyze`` Axe class method.

The purpose of this change is to separate implementations that are specific to the Mozilla Firefox Test Engineering team, and leave the base ``axe-selenium-python`` package for a more broad use case. This package was modeled off of Deque's Java package, axe-selenium-java, and will now more closely mirror it.

All functionalities can still be utilized when using ``axe-selenium-python`` in conjunction with ``pytest-axe``.

version 1.2.3
**************
- Added the analyze method to the Axe class. This method runs accessibility checks, and writes the JSON results to file based on the page URL and the timestamp.
- Writing results to file can be enabled by setting the environment variable ``ACCESSIBILITY_REPORTING=true``. The files will be written to ``results/`` directory, which must be created if it does not already exist.
- Accessibility checks can be disabled by setting the environment variable ``ACCESSIBILITY_DISABLED=true``.

version 1.2.1
**************
- Updated axe to ``axe-core@2.6.1``
- Modified impact_included class method to reflect changes to the aXe API:
- There are now only 3 impact levels: 'critical', 'serious', and 'minor'

version 1.0.0
**************
- Updated usage examples in README
- Added docstrings to methods lacking documentation
- Removed unused files

version 0.0.3
**************
- Added run method to Axe class to simplify the usage in existing test suites
- run method includes the ability to set what impact level to test for: 'minor', 'moderate', 'severe', 'critical'
